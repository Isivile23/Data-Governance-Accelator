## Chapter 1: Defining Data Governance

### Understanding Data Governance

* Data Govenance is about proactively managing your data in order to support your orgnization to achieve its strategy and objectives. You do this by improving the quality of your data.
* Three things that your organisation needs to be successful:
  1. A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
  2. Roles and Responsibilities concerning data.
  3. Processes detailing whats needs to be done to manage data. 
  
#### What is meant by governance?

* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important.

#### What is data governance?

* Data govenance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

#### Data Governance Versus Data Management

* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

#### Data Governance and Information Governance

* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

#### The Value of Data Governance

  * Fundamentally, data is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It enforces a leap from an ad hoc approach to daa to one that is strategic in nature.
  * Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

    1. Improved data quality
    2. Expanded data value
    3. Increased data compliance
    4. Improved data-driven decision-making
    5. Enhanced business performance
    6. Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
    7. Increased data availability and accessibility
    8. Improved data search
    9. Reduced risks from data-related issues
    10. Reduced data management costs
    11. Established rules for handling data

### Creating a Data Governance Program

The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course:

1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management
3. Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan
4. Achieving leadership approval
5. Designing and developing the program
6. Implementing the program
7. Monitoring and measuring performance
8. Maintaining the program

* Data governance is about managing data well and helping to deliver its optimum value to your organization.
* It includes ensuring your data is available, usable, and secure.
* Its the actions that team members take, the policies and processes they must follow, and the use of technologies that support them throughout the data lifecycle in their organization.
* It's safe to say that for a growing number of organizations, data governance is becoming a very big deal.

#### Leadership and Strategy

* Data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization.
* Data plays a role in many aspects of organizational strategy, including risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies, so you must ensure theres clear alignment between these aspects and the goals of data governance.

#### Roles and Responsibilities

* Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
* Every data governance framework includes the identification and assignment of specific roles and responsibilities, which range from the information technology (IT) team to data stewards.

#### Policies, Processes, and Standards

* At the heart of data governance program are policies, processes, and standards that guide responsibilities and support uniformity across the organization. Each of this must be designed,developed, and deployed.
* Depending on the size and complexity of the organization.

#### Metrics

* The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results.
* Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is importrant for maintaing support, which includes funding.
* You'll want to know if your efforts are delivering on the promise of the program.
* Based on the metrics, you and your team can make continuous improvements to ensure that the program is producing value.

#### Tools 

* Fortunately, a large market now exists for tools in support of data governance and management.
* These include tools foe master data management,data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
* In recent years, many data science-related tools have made leaps in terms of incorporating ease-of-use and automation.
* What used to be complex has been democratized and empowered more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

#### Communication and Collarboration

* With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key.
* This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
* Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.

### Preparing for Data Governance

#### What is data culture?

* Culture will always defeat the greatest of strategies almost every time. Imagine for a moment designing and deploying a data governance program for an organization that has little or no data culture. Intuitively this sounds like a disaster in the making. To be fair, every organization has some form of a data culture; it just might not be in an ideal state.

#### Assessing the Data Culture

* On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture).

### Maturing the Data Culture


If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start. Good news! Many of these items are covered in detail in this course. 

1. Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
   
2. Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.

3. Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
 
4. Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

#### Assessing Data Governance Readiness

This course takes you through all the steps for designing and creating a data governance program, but you also have to consider the readiness of an organization prior to beginning the journey.

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

* The basis of data culture exists.
* The program is 100 percent aligned with the business strategy.
* Senior leadershipp is 100 percent committed to program and its goals.
* Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
* One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
* The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
* The organization understands tis is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
* You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
* Legal and compliance teams understand and supports the goals of the program.
* Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
* The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

## Chapter 2: Exploring a World Overflowing with Data

### Defining Data

A solid definition of data and its role today gets us on the same page and sets the stage for delivering on the promise of data governance.

#### Why all the focus on data

* Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device.
* These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer.
* Single units of data are tradionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data.

Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:

1. Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
2. Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
3. Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

### Welcome to The Zettabyte Era

* As we entered the 21st century and the volume of data being created and stored grew rapidly. A hyperconnected world accelerating in its adoption and use of digital tools has required dusting off a seldom-used metric to capture the enormity of data output we were producing.

* Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.

### From Data to Insight

* Data that is never used is about as useful as producing reports that nobody reads. The assumption is that you have data for a reason. You have your data and it’s incredibly important to your organization, but it must be converted to information to have meaning.

The differences Between Data and Information:

![image](https://github.com/Isivile23/Data-Governance-Accelator/assets/162969923/0c99aff9-8255-4bc3-ad2a-0fa0869d0448)


* Information is the raw data or facts we encounter.
* Knowledge is what we get when we understand and can use that information. It's about applying information in a practical way.
* Wisdom builds on knowledge by adding judgment and experience. It's knowing not just what to do, but also when and why to do it.
* Insight is the deepest level of understanding. It combines knowledge and wisdom to see things in a new light and make better decisions.

To summarize, consider the following:

* Harry Styles is data.
* The fact that Harry Styles is a singer and was in the group, One Direction, is information.
* The fact that Harry Styles has aspirations to become a solo artist and is looking for a record deal is knowledge.
* The fact that One Direction was a very successful band with talented and popular individuals and knowing that Harry Styles is a creative artist who now wants a solo record deal is wisdom.
* Ensuring that Columbia Records make the decision to sign Harry Styles before anyone else does is insight.

### The Role of Data in the 21st Century

Data's importance has skyrocketed since the mid-20th century. While always valuable, the explosion of computer systems dramatically increased the amount, quality, and accessibility of data. The internet's arrival in the 90s echoed the dream of information at everyone's fingertips, making data a true game-changer.

### Data-Driven Decision-Making

Data empowers better decision-making. From simple things like choosing a restaurant based on online reviews to complex business decisions like entering a new market, data analysis can be the key to success. Having the right data and the tools to understand it can mean the difference between a well-informed choice and a costly mistake.

### Data as The New Oil

Data is seen as the new oil, echoing the crucial role oil played in economies.  However, there's a key similarity: both need refinement.  Oil is processed into usable products, and data requires analysis to reveal patterns, inform decisions, and solve problems.

Data is the fuel of the 21st century's digital economies, similar to how oil powered the industrial era. Tech giants like Facebook and Google exemplify this.  This data-driven transformation is impacting every industry, with data management becoming a strategic asset (profit center) for many.  However, a concern arises: just like oil dependence, control of massive valuable data by a few players concentrates power, potentially mirroring the challenges of the oil era. We should learn from the past to manage potential risks associated with data control.

### Data Ownership 

* Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.

### Data Architecture

Every organization relies on technology to operate, making them all tech businesses in a way.  Enterprise Architecture (EA) helps design the right tech, policies, and projects to  support an organization's goals. Data Architecture, a part of EA, focuses on how data is designed and managed to align with this overall strategy.  In simpler terms, it's the agreed plan for how data fuels an organization's functions and technologies.

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

* Ensuring data is available to those wo need it and are approved to use it.
* Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
* Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
* Adopting and aggreing to data standards
* Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

Data architecture isn't just a technical thing, it reflects an organization's data governance practices.  A well-designed data architecture shows the organization values its data, manages it strategically, and has controls to ensure it aligns with business goals.  Similar to enterprise architecture, data architecture is a shared responsibility across the organization, not just for IT specialists.  In larger organizations, data needs to move smoothly between departments and serve diverse users in various formats.

### The Lifecycle of Data


![image](https://github.com/Isivile23/Data-Governance-Accelator/assets/162969923/607e5814-d3e5-4e7b-b22f-22e4091e098e)

1. Creation: This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
2. Storage:  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
3. Usage: Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
4. Archival:   In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
5. Destruction: Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

### Understanding the impact of Big Data

Data has been around for a long time, even before computers. People have been recording information for millennia, like the Romans using ledgers. The 20th century saw a boom in data collection and processing due to advancements like microprocessors and the Cold War era's space race.

#### The Role od The U.S Census in The Information Revolution

Data processing has a long history, dating back to the 1800s. The need to efficiently analyze census data led to the invention of punch card tabulation machines by the Tabulating Machine Company (later IBM). These machines used punched cards to represent data and could perform basic calculations.

Over time, data processing technology advanced, impacting various sectors like offices, factories, and academia. This progress laid the groundwork for the information age, where data became the fuel for innovation. Increased connectivity allowed for the free flow of information, leading to an explosion in data creation, storage, and use.

By the 21st century, the sheer volume and speed of data created a "data swamp," making traditional software struggle to manage it. This phenomenon led to the coining of the term "big data" to describe the challenges and opportunities associated with massive datasets.

### Defining Big Data 

Big data is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.

#### Defining Big Data
One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:

1. Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
2. Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
3. Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
4. Variability: The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
5. Veracity: :  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

#### Drivers of Big Data
