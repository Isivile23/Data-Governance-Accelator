## Chapter 1: Defining Data Governance

### Understanding Data Governance

* Data Govenance is about proactively managing your data in order to support your orgnization to achieve its strategy and objectives. You do this by improving the quality of your data.
* Three things that your organisation needs to be successful:
  1. A policy to mandate how your organisation is going to manage data.
  2. Roles and Responsibilities concerning data.
  3. Processes detailing whats needs to be done to manage data. 
  
#### What is meant by governance?

* Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest.
* It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
* When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important.

#### What is data governance?

* Data govenance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.
* Successful data governance also means that data risks can be minimized, and data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease. This can bring important comfort to business leaders who, in some jurisdictions, can now be personally liable for issues arising from poor data management.

#### Data Governance Versus Data Management

* Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data.
* Data management is the technical implementation of data governance.  For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

#### Data Governance and Information Governance

* Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences.
* Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

  #### The Value of Data Governance

  * Fundamentally, data is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It enforces a leap from an ad hoc approach to daa to one that is strategic in nature.
  * Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

    1. Improved data quality
    2. Expanded data value
    3. Increased data compliance
    4. Improved data-driven decision-making
    5. Enhanced business performance
    6. Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
    7. Increased data availability and accessibility
    8. Improved data search
    9. Reduced risks from data-related issues
    10. Reduced data management costs
    11. Established rules for handling data
